## a small demo sample in python using azure api to grab information and deployed on SUSE Cloud foundry

### *movivation*
*I wanted to write a small app, deploy it on suse cloud foundry and show how easy it is. But I wanted to build an example which can utilize some 3rd party api showing to get data from others out from cloud foundry environment. So I chose Microsoft Azure python SDK to pull some data.*

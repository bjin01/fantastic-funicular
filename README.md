## a small demo sample in python using azure api to grab information and deployed on SUSE Cloud foundry

### *motivation*
*I wanted to write a small app, deploy it on suse cloud foundry and show how easy it is. But I wanted to build an example which can utilize some 3rd party api showing to get data from others out from cloud foundry environment. So I chose Microsoft Azure python SDK to pull some data.*

### *Usage*

On your workstation or laptop or PC clone my repo down to you.

`git clone https://github.com/bjin01/fantastic-funicular.git`

Once you are in the git cloned subdir:

`cf push`

Of course you can adapt the manifest.yml to make it fit to your cloud foundry platform.
